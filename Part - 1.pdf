Part 1: Theoretical Understanding 
1. Short Answer Questions

Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

    PyTorch and TensorFlow primarily differ in their computation graphs (dynamic vs. static), flexibility, and production readiness.
        - PyTorch uses dynamic graphs (define-by-run), is favored for research and rapid prototyping due to its intuitive, "Pythonic" feel and native debugging support.
        - TensorFlow uses static graphs (define-and-run, though it has dynamic options), excels in large-scale production deployment to diverse platforms (mobile, web), and offers a robust, all-in-one ecosystem for the full machine learning lifecycle.


Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

    Jupyter Notebooks support AI development primarily through two key use cases:
      
        - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization: They provide an interactive environment for data cleaning, transformation, and immediate visualization of data insights using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
          This iterative approach helps in understanding the dataset before modeling.
      
        - Rapid Prototyping and Model Development: The cell-by-cell execution facilitates quick experimentation with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning. 
          This "scratchpad" environment accelerates the iterative process of building and testing model variations efficiently.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

    spaCy enhances NLP by providing a fast, "linguistically aware" pipeline that replaces rudimentary string operations with sophisticated features like tokenization, 
    part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition (NER), enabling deep text understanding efficiently.



2. Comparative Analysis

    Compare Scikit-learn and TensorFlow in terms of:

        Target applications (e.g., classical ML vs. deep learning).
        Ease of use for beginners.
        Community support.

    Scikit-learn:
        Target Applications: Primarily for classical machine learning tasks (regression, clustering, classification) using structured, tabular data.
        Ease of Use: Highly beginner-friendly with a simple, consistent API that abstracts complexity.
        Community Support: Strong academic and general ML community known for excellent documentation.
    TensorFlow:
        Target Applications: Built for deep learning and complex neural networks, handling unstructured data like images and large text volumes.
        Ease of Use: Has a steeper learning curve, involving concepts like tensors and computational graphs, though Keras simplifies much of it.
        Community Support: Massive industry-focused and enterprise community, driven largely by Google, offering extensive deployment tools.
